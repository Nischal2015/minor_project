      I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar
      Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of
      substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids—and I might even be said
      to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people
      refuse to see me. I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of
      getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It’s when
      you know you’re licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it
      through no matter what.
